I am currently building <a href="https://fragment.run">Fragment</a> with <a href="https://omoindrot.github.io">Olivier Moindrot</a>. We previously led the AI team of a KYC provider together and we saw the limitations of KYC and how they expose fintechs to fraudsters.

We want to build the next real-time AI platform to fight fraud (subscribe on <a href="https://fragment.run">Fragment</a> to get updates).


I have extensive experience in Machine Learning, from modelling (both in NLP, Computer Vision and Recommendation systems) to ML Ops.
