I am currently building <a href="https://checkfragment.com">Fragment</a> with <a href="https://omoindrot.github.io">Olivier Moindrot</a>. 

Fragment manages human-in-the-loop operations for AI companies.

I previously held various engineering roles in Machine Learning. More specifically, I led the AI team of a KYC provider which handled identity verification with a mix of AI and human experts.

I have extensive experience in Machine Learning, from modeling (both in NLP, Computer Vision and Recommendation systems) to ML Ops.
