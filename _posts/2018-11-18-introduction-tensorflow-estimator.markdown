## Introduction

Not so long ago, designing Deep Learning software meant writing custom `Model` classes. However, with code and implementations piling up on github and other open-source platforms, developers soon had enough examples to start designing __unified high-level APIs for models and data loading__. After all, we are all lazy and writing boilerplate code is not necessarily our cup of tea.

Thanks to intense competition on the Deep Learning Framework landscape, driving innovation and development of new functionalities, brillant minds at Google and elsewhere worked on new additions to Tensorflow. Don't ask me which version has it all (but I'm pretty sure 1.9 is good enough).

<!-- For those unfamiliar with Tensorflow, just wanting to bootstrap their project and reading on the web good and bad things about it, especially how so much more user-friendly its rival, Facebook's newborn [pyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is, well, forget about those sterile debates and try them both: they are more than good enough and when it comes to chosing which one to use for your company or your project, it depends more on what existing implementation is available and your technical debt than the frameworks' specificities. -->

This blog post provides an __example of how to use `tf.data` and `tf.estimator` for NLP__ and demonstrate how you can quickly get a state-of-the-art NLP model up and running with as few as a 100 lines of Tensorflow code!

<a id="global-configuration"></a>
## Global configuration

If you like having an idea about what's happening when you're running your code, you need to change the __level of verbosity__ of tensorflow logging (the module `tf.logging` which is built on top of the standard `logging` module). It does seem a bit weird that we have to take care of it, but hey, nothing is perfect and there probably is a reason that I am unaware of (nobody's omniscient).

This snippet of code does a bit more than changing the verbosity: it also writes everything that tensorflow logs to a __file__. This is especially useful when you execute your code on a cluster of machines thanks to the help of a job manager (like slurm). The logs of `stdout` are probably accessible somewhere else, but I still think it's better to have a version of it along with your weights and other stuff.

```python
import logging
from pathlib import Path
import sys

import tensorflow as tf

# Setup logging
Path('results').mkdir(exist_ok=True)
tf.logging.set_verbosity(logging.INFO)
handlers = [
    logging.FileHandler('results/main.log'),
    logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
]
logging.getLogger('tensorflow').handlers = handlers
```

> If you don't know / don't use the [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) module (python3 only), try using it. It bundles a lot of `os.path` functionnality (and more) in a much nicer and easy-to-use package. I started using it after reading about it on [this blog](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f) which also has a lot of other excellent articles.

> We create two `handlers`: one that will write the logs to `sys.stdout` (the terminal window so that you can see what's going on), and one to a file (as the `FileHandler` name implies). I prefer resetting the `handlers` completely to avoid double-logging.

So far, no Deep Learning, no Tensorflow (or barely), just python trickery.


<a id="feed-data-with-tfdata"></a>
## Feed data with tf.data


When it comes to feeding data to your model (and to the tensorflow graph), there has been a few possible ways of achieving this in the past. The standard technique was to use a `tf.placeholder` that was updated through the `run` method of a `tf.Session` object. There was also an attempt of a more optimized input pipeline with [threadings and queues](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/threading_and_queues).

Forget all this (first of all because we won't use `tf.Session` anymore).

A better (and almost perfect) way of __feeding data to your tensorflow model__ is to use a wonderful new tensorflow API called [`tf.data`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data) (thanks to the efforts of [Derek Murray](https://github.com/mrry) and others) whose philosophy, in a few words, is to create a special node of the graph that knows how to iterate the data and yield batches of tensors.

There is a bunch of official tutorials that you can find on the [official website](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - something alas quite unusual. Here is a (short) selection:

- [The official guide - Importing Data](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/datasets)
- [How to use `tf.data.Dataset` with the high level model API `tf.estimator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/datasets_for_estimators)
- [The Neural Machine Translation Tutorial - A good example for NLP](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt)

<a id="a-simple-example"></a>
### A simple example

I am a great fan of the flexibility provided by `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator`. It allows you to do the data loading (from file or elsewhere) and some preprocessing in python before feeding it into the graph. Basically, defining such a dataset is just wiring the outputs of any python generator into Tensorflow Tensors.


Let's define a dummy data generator

```python
def generator_fn():
    for digit in range(2):
        line = 'I am digit {}'.format(digit)
        words = line.split()
        yield [w.encode() for w in words], len(words)
```

which yields
```python
for words in generator_fn():
    print(words)
>>> ([b'I', b'am', b'digit', b'0'], 4)
>>> ([b'I', b'am', b'digit', b'1'], 4)
```
> __Good to know__: when feeding string objects to your graph, you need to encode your string to `bytes`.


Now, we want to make the output of this generator available inside our graph. Let's create a special `Dataset` node


```python
shapes = ([None], ())
types = (tf.string, tf.int32)

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(generator_fn,
    output_shapes=shapes, output_types=types)
```
> Tensorflow provides other ways of creating datasets, from text files (see `tf.data.TextLineDataset
`), from np arrays (see `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices`, from TF records (see `tf.data.TFRecordDataset
`), etc. For most NLP cases, I advise you to take advantage of the flexibility given by `tf.data.from_generator` unless you need the extra boost in performance provided by the other fancier options.


<a id="test-your-tfdata-pipeline"></a>
### Test your tf.data pipeline


> It is __necessary to test__ that your `tf.data` pipeline works as expected to avoid long hours of unnecessary headache and debugging.

There are 2 techniques to test your `dataset`.

1. Use the new `eager_execution` mode

    ```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    tf.enable_eager_execution()

    for tf_words, tf_size in dataset:
        print(tf_words, tf_size)
    >>> tf.Tensor([b'I' b'am' b'digit' b'0'], shape=(4,), dtype=string) tf.Tensor(4, shape=(), dtype=int32)
    >>> tf.Tensor([b'I' b'am' b'digit' b'1'], shape=(4,), dtype=string) tf.Tensor(4, shape=(), dtype=int32)
    ```
    > The `tf.enable_eager_execution()` must be called at program startup, just after your `import tensorflow as tf`

2. Use an old-school, not-so-user-friendly-but-still-usefull `tf.Session`. Before that, we need to create an `iterator` out of our dataset. In other words, a dataset is an object that can be iterated, but we need to get the node created when iterating the dataset in order to evaluate it explicitely via a `Session`.

    ```python
    iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
    node = iterator.get_next()
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        print(sess.run(node))
        print(sess.run(node))  # Each call moves the iterator to its next position
    >>> (array([b'I', b'am', b'digit', b'0'], dtype=object), 4)
    >>> (array([b'I', b'am', b'digit', b'1'], dtype=object), 4)
    ```
    > `print(node)` sums up the above explanation in *tensorflow-ic* jargon - though a bit abstruse `(<tf.Tensor 'IteratorGetNext_1:0' shape=(?,) dtype=string>, <tf.Tensor 'IteratorGetNext_1:1' shape=() dtype=int32>)`

<a id="read-from-file-and-tokenize"></a>
### Read from file and tokenize

Now, a more __complete example__. We have 2 files `words` and `tags`, each line containing a white-spaced tokenized tagged sentence.

1. The generator function, that reads the files and parse the lines

    ```python
    def parse_fn(line_words, line_tags):
        # Encode in Bytes for TF
        words = [w.encode() for w in line_words.strip().split()]
        tags = [t.encode() for t in line_tags.strip().split()]
        assert len(words) == len(tags), "Words and tags lengths don't match"
        return (words, len(words)), tags


    def generator_fn(words, tags):
        with Path(words).open('r') as f_words, Path(tags).open('r') as f_tags:
            for line_words, line_tags in zip(f_words, f_tags):
                yield parse_fn(line_words, line_tags)
    ```
    > Again, notice how we encode strings into `bytes`

2. The `input_fn` that constructs the dataset (we will need this function to work with `tf.estimator` later on)

    ```python
    def input_fn(words, tags, params=None, shuffle_and_repeat=False):
        params = params if params is not None else {}
        shapes = (([None], ()), [None])
        types = ((tf.string, tf.int32), tf.string)
        defaults = (('<pad>', 0), 'O')

        dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(
            functools.partial(generator_fn, words, tags),
            output_shapes=shapes, output_types=types)

        if shuffle_and_repeat:
            dataset = dataset.shuffle(params['buffer']).repeat(params['epochs'])

        dataset = (dataset
                   .padded_batch(params.get('batch_size', 20), shapes, defaults)
                   .prefetch(1))
        return dataset

    ```
    > Notice how we perform a few operations on our `dataset` like `shuffle`, `repeat`, `padded_batch` and `prefetch`. These operations are self-explanatory, except maybe for `prefetch` which ensures that a batch of data is pre-loaded on the computing device so that it does not suffer from data starvation (= wasting compute resources that have to wait for the data to be transfered, a problem that occurs with GPUs and low compute / data ratios)

    > Also be aware of the order of these operations. We want to `shuffle` before repeating (so that we shuffle inside one epoch = one full pass on the dataset). We then apply batching and the very final step is to prefetch.

We don't forget to try out our new pipeline. Let's create 2 files
1. `words.txt`
    ```
    I live in San Francisco
    You live in Paris
    ```

2. `tags.txt`
    ```
    O O O B-LOC I-LOC
    O O O S-LOC
    ```

And run the following code

```python
dataset = input_fn('words.txt', 'tags.txt')
iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
node = iterator.get_next()
with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(node))
>>> ((array([[b'I', b'live', b'in', b'San', b'Francisco'],
>>>          [b'You', b'live', b'in', b'Paris', b'<pad>']],
>>>         dtype=object),
>>>   array([5, 4], dtype=int32)),
>>>   array([[b'O', b'O', b'O', b'B-LOC', b'I-LOC'],
>>>          [b'O', b'O', b'O', b'S-LOC', b'O']],
>>>          dtype=object))
```
> As you can see, the `padded_batch` worked as desired, by adding new tokens to the shorter sentence. Now, we have a batch of data which is ready to be consumed by our model!


<a id="define-a-model-with-tfestimator"></a>
## Define a model with tf.estimator

Now let's briefly give an overview of the `tf.estimator` paradigm. It consists of a high-level class `tf.estimator.Estimator` that provides all the useful training / evaluation / predict methods and handles weight serialization, Tensorboard etc. for you. To get such an instance, you need to define __two components__:

1. A `model_fn(features, labels, mode, params) -> tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec` whose signature is strict and will hold the graph definition.
    - `features` and `labels` are tensors (possibly nested structure of tensors, meaning tuples or dictionaries)
    - `mode` is a string, set by the Estimator. We will use this to specialize our `model_fn` depending on the mode (PREDICT, EVAL or TRAIN).
    - `params` is a dictionnary that will contain all our hyperparameters.

2. An `input_fn` (as the one we defined above) that returns a `tf.data.Dataset`, which yields the `features` and `labels` consumed by the `model_fn`.

<a id="what-if-i-need-to-manually-set-my-features-and-labels"></a>
### What if I need to manually set my features and labels?

The `input_fn` can also directly return the "nodes" obtained after iterating the dataset. This can be handy if you want to manually create your `features` as a dictionnary, or manually set labels to `None` in the case of a `predict_input_fn` for example. You would add these few lines at the end of the `input_fn`:
```python
iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
(words, nwords), tags = iterator.get_next()
features = {'words': words, 'nwords': words}
labels = {'tags': tags}  # Could be None in your predict_input_fn
return features, labels
```


<a id="global-logic-of-the-model_fn"></a>
### Global Logic of the model_fn

The global design of the `model_fn` is straightforward, with no boilerplate code:


```python
def model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):
    # Define the inference graph
    graph_outputs = some_tensorflow_applied_to(features)

    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.PREDICT:
        # Extract the predictions
        predictions = some_dict_from(graph_outputs)
        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, predictions=predictions)
    else:
        # Compute loss, metrics, tensorboard summaries
        loss = compute_loss_from(graph_outputs, labels)
        metrics = compute_metrics_from(graph_outputs, labels)

        if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.EVAL:
            return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(
                mode, loss=loss, eval_metric_ops=metrics)

        elif mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN:
            # Get train operator
            train_op = compute_train_op_from(graph_outputs, labels)
            return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(
                mode, loss=loss, train_op=train_op)

        else:
            raise NotImplementedError('Unknown mode {}'.format(mode))
```
> Notice the hierarchisation and how each node is defined after an other, depending on the `mode`.

And that's all you need to define!

You can read the next part to get some details about our specific model and how we add metrics etc. If you want to know how to combine the `model_fn` with the `input_fn`, jump to the [last part](#instantiate-an-estimator)!


<a id="define-a-bi-lstm--crf-model_fn"></a>
### Define a bi-LSTM + CRF model_fn

Let's implement a bi-LSTM + CRF for sequence tagging (Named Entity Recognition is one application) as defined in [one of my other blog posts](https://guillaumegenthial.github.io/sequence-tagging-with-tensorflow.html). Here is a step-by-step of the different blocks of our `model_fn`.

{% include image.html url="/assets/ner.png" description="Named Entity Recognition" size="100%" %}


You can find the full implementation [here](https://github.com/guillaumegenthial/tf_ner/blob/master/models/lstm_crf/main.py).


<a id="parameters-and-vocabulary-tables"></a>
#### Parameters and vocabulary tables

Let's extract and define a few variables at the beginning of our `model_fn` for easier reuse later on.
Nothing spectacular here, except that we use a `tf.contrib.lookup.index_table_from_file` that maps strings to ids in the Tensorflow graph.

```python
dropout = params['dropout']
words, nwords = features
training = (mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN)
vocab_words = tf.contrib.lookup.index_table_from_file(
    params['words'], num_oov_buckets=1)
with Path(params['tags']).open() as f:
    indices = [idx for idx, tag in enumerate(f) if tag.strip() != 'O']
    num_tags = len(indices) + 1
```
> Here, `params['words']` is the path to a file containing one lexeme (= an element of my vocabulary) per line. I use Tensorflow built-int lookup tables to map token strings to lexemes ids.
> We also use the same convention to store the vocabulary of `tags`.


<a id="word-embeddings"></a>
#### Word Embeddings

The __first step__ in our graph is getting the word representation.

1. Use the __Tensorflow vocabulary lookup table to map token strings to ids__.
2. Reload a `np.array` containing some pre-trained vectors (like GloVe) where the row index corresponds to a lexeme id.
3. Perform a lookup in this array to get the embedding of every token
4. Apply dropout to the dense representation to prevent overfitting

```python
word_ids = vocab_words.lookup(words)
glove = np.load(params['glove'])['embeddings']  # np.array
variable = np.vstack([glove, [[0.]*params['dim']]])  # For unknown words
variable = tf.Variable(variable, dtype=tf.float32, trainable=False)
embeddings = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(variable, word_ids)
embeddings = tf.layers.dropout(embeddings, rate=dropout, training=training)
```
> Because some words might be absent from the vocabulary, we defined a non-zero `num_oov_buckets` in our vocabulary lookup table, which reserves new ids for unknown tokens. This means that we have to add new vectors for this ids at the end of our array of pre-trained embeddings.

<a id="efficient-bi-lstm-with-lstmblockfusedcell"></a>
#### Efficient bi-LSTM with `LSTMBlockFusedCell`

The __second step__ is getting the context representation by applying a bi-LSTM on top of the token representation.

We use the most efficient implementation of the LSTM cell that combines all the LSTM operations (including recursion) in one CUDA kernel (at least that's what I think is happening here).
> This `LSTMBlockFusedCell` operates on the entire time sequence (__no need__ to perform any recursion on our side like a `tf.nn.bidirectional_dynamic_rnn` call). However, it requires a Tensor of shape `[time_len x batch_size x input_size]` which means we have to transpose our `embeddings` tensor to be time-major.

```python
t = tf.transpose(embeddings, perm=[1, 0, 2])  # Make time-major
lstm_cell_fw = tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMBlockFusedCell(params['lstm_size'])
lstm_cell_bw = tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMBlockFusedCell(params['lstm_size'])
lstm_cell_bw = tf.contrib.rnn.TimeReversedFusedRNN(lstm_cell_bw)
output_fw, _ = lstm_cell_fw(t, dtype=tf.float32, sequence_length=nwords)
output_bw, _ = lstm_cell_bw(t, dtype=tf.float32, sequence_length=nwords)
output = tf.concat([output_fw, output_bw], axis=-1)
output = tf.transpose(output, perm=[1, 0, 2])  # Make batch-major
output = tf.layers.dropout(output, rate=dropout, training=training)
```


<a id="tensorflow-crf"></a>
#### Tensorflow CRF

The __third step__ is decoding the sentence using a CRF.

We need to define our crf_params variable ourselves because we will need it to compute the CRF loss reusing the same parameters later on.

```python
logits = tf.layers.dense(output, num_tags)
crf_params = tf.get_variable("crf", [num_tags, num_tags], dtype=tf.float32)
pred_ids, _ = tf.contrib.crf.crf_decode(logits, crf_params, nwords)
```

> Now we've defined our graph outputs. Let's cover the rest of the `model_fn`.

<a id="predict-mode"></a>
#### PREDICT Mode

We create a reverse table to map the predicted tag ids back to tag strings and bundle our graph outputs into a `predictions` dictionary. It is important to notice here that the `EstimatorSpec` of the PREDICT mode only has tensors that depend on `features`. We haven't used the `labels` so far (we will for the EVAL and TRAIN mode though).

```python
if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.PREDICT:
    # Predictions
    reverse_vocab_tags = tf.contrib.lookup.index_to_string_table_from_file(
        params['tags'])
    pred_strings = reverse_vocab_tags.lookup(tf.to_int64(pred_ids))
    predictions = {
        'pred_ids': pred_ids,
        'tags': pred_strings
    }
    return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, predictions=predictions)
```

<a id="loss-for-eval-and-train-modes"></a>
#### Loss for EVAL and TRAIN modes

We re-use our `crf_params` defined above to get the CRF loss and, again, use an `index_table_from_file` to map the tag strings to tag ids.

```python
vocab_tags = tf.contrib.lookup.index_table_from_file(params['tags'])
tags = vocab_tags.lookup(labels)
log_likelihood, _ = tf.contrib.crf.crf_log_likelihood(
    logits, tags, nwords, crf_params)
loss = tf.reduce_mean(-log_likelihood)
```

<a id="metrics-and-tensorboard"></a>
#### Metrics and Tensorboard

We use one of my other projects, [tf_metrics](https://github.com/guillaumegenthial/tf_metrics) to get the __micro average of multiclass classification metrics like precision, recall and f1__, in the same way as scikit-learn does it. This allows us to treat the special null class `O` as a proper null class and get a global score of our model's performance (at the token level).


```python
import tf_metrics

# Metrics
weights = tf.sequence_mask(nwords)
metrics = {
    'acc': tf.metrics.accuracy(tags, pred_ids, weights),
    'precision': tf_metrics.precision(tags, pred_ids, num_tags, indices, weights),
    'recall': tf_metrics.recall(tags, pred_ids, num_tags, indices, weights),
    'f1': tf_metrics.f1(tags, pred_ids, num_tags, indices, weights),
}
# Tensoboard summaries
for metric_name, op in metrics.items():
    tf.summary.scalar(metric_name, op[1])
```

You can install [`tf_metrics`](https://github.com/guillaumegenthial/tf_metrics) with

`pip install git+https://github.com/guillaumegenthial/tf_metrics.git`

<a id="eval-and-train-modes"></a>
#### EVAL and TRAIN modes

Now that everything is setup, it is easy to define our EstimatorSpec for the EVAL and TRAIN modes.

```python
if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.EVAL:
    return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(
        mode, loss=loss, eval_metric_ops=metrics)

elif mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN:
    train_op = tf.train.AdamOptimizer().minimize(
        loss, global_step=tf.train.get_or_create_global_step())
    return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(
        mode, loss=loss, train_op=train_op)
```

<a id="instantiate-an-estimator"></a>
## Instantiate an Estimator

Initializing our model is just a few lines of codes. As expected, we just need to provide the `model_fn` and some extra configuration.

```python
# Params
params = {
    'dim': 300,
    'dropout': 0.5,
    'num_oov_buckets': 1,
    'epochs': 25,
    'batch_size': 20,
    'buffer': 15000,
    'lstm_size': 100,
    'words': str(Path(DATADIR, 'vocab.words.txt')),

## Train an Estimator with early stopping

Now that we have our estimator, we need to perform 3 steps

1. Fully define our `input_fn` on our different datasets. Because the `tf.estimator` API expects callables, we use the standard `functools` library to provide parameters upon execution
2. We want to train our Estimator as long as our f1 score keeps improving (early-stopping). A way of achieving this is to use a [`stop_if_no_increase_hook`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/estimator/stop_if_no_increase_hook). Because the hook somehow assumes that the model's `eval_dir` has already been created when it is first called (which is not always the case with our RunConfig), let's make sure that the `eval_dir` exists before even running our training.
3. Finally, run our training with the `train_and_evaluate`. This method has recently been updated and does not destroy / re-create the graph each time we switch from training to evaluation and vice versa, which results in a very fast and efficient training process with automated evaluation on the development set once in a while! It also supports more advanced uses, like distributed training and evaluation etc. (out of the scope of this post).


```python
# 1. Define our input_fn
train_inpf = functools.partial(input_fn, 'words.train.txt', 'tags.train.txt',
                               params, shuffle_and_repeat=True)
eval_inpf = functools.partial(input_fn,'words.testa.txt', 'tags.testa.txt'
                              params)

# 2. Create a hook
Path(estimator.eval_dir()).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
hook = tf.contrib.estimator.stop_if_no_increase_hook(
    estimator, 'f1', 500, min_steps=8000, run_every_secs=120)
train_spec = tf.estimator.TrainSpec(input_fn=input_fn, hooks=[hook])
eval_spec = tf.estimator.EvalSpec(input_fn=eval_inpf, throttle_secs=120)

# 3. Train with early stopping
tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate(estimator, train_spec, eval_spec)
```

and now you should see appear stuff like


```
Running training and evaluation locally (non-distributed).
Start train and evaluate loop. The evaluate will happen after every checkpoint. Checkpoint frequency is determined based on RunConfig arguments: save_checkpoints_steps None or save_checkpoints_secs 60.

## Results and Conclusion

You will find the complete implementation on [github](https://github.com/guillaumegenthial/tf_ner) as well as other variants (with character embeddings, with Exponential Moving Average of weights, etc.).

For those curious about the results yielded by this implementation, I've conducted a few __experiments on the CoNLL2003 dataset__, training on `train` only with early stopping on `testa` and reported average, standard deviation and best of 5 runs. To compare with the results to the __paper__ [Bidirectional LSTM-CRF Models for Sequence Tagging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01991) by Huang, Xu and Yu.

__Training time__ ~ 20 min on my laptop.
